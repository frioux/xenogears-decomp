# Decompilation tracker

Live log of an autonomous 12-hour work session. One row per landed batch.
`make check` must pass for a row to land (all six outputs `OK`).

Baseline at session start (2026-11-08):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| functions matched | 1632 / 2528 (64.56%) |
| code matched | 307928 / 670864 bytes (45.90%) |
| fuzzy match | 46.40% |
| `INCLUDE_ASM` stubs | 761 |

Stubs by area at session start: `slus_006.64` 419 (psyq 174, system 245),
`field` 301, `lib_gear` 29, `shop_menu` 9, `gear_shop_menu` 2,
`member_change_menu` 1.

## Log

| # | Batch | Functions | Total | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | baseline | — | 1632 | session start |
| 1 | `field/main/{misc,misc2,misc8}`, `system/sound`, `shop_menu/main/misc` | +14 | 1646 | 26 claimed; 12 rejected by `make check` (9 wrong size, 3 wrong registers) |
| 2 | `system/temp1`, `system/model` | +17 | 1663 | temp1 12 (gcc 2.7.2-cdk), model 5; 4 more units came back unverified from timed-out workers and were dropped |
| 3 | `system/{sound,rendering}`, `field/main/{misc2,misc11,misc8,misc}` | +21 | 1684 | sound 6, rendering 6 (needed a `XenoRendering` maspsx preset: no li expansion), misc2 6, misc11 2, misc8 1, misc 0; every claim survived `make check` |
| 4 | `field/main/misc9`, `system/temp3` | +9 | 1695 | most units came back as near misses (one register or one delay slot); misc9 5, temp3 4 |
| 5 | 10 units | +29 | 1724 | first round with the shared "known blockers" playbook in the brief; every claim survived `make check` |
| 6 | 10 units | +32 | 1756 | `field/main/misc` 9/9, `system/sound` 5/5; `text_box_render` handed back a file that did not compile (INCLUDE_ASM expanded inside a body) and was reverted |
| 7 | 10 units | +25 | 1780 | crossed 70% of functions; `shop_menu` revert for a 2-byte jump-table data difference |
| 8 | 10 units | +21 | 1801 | reverted a C-side `.rodata` constant in `misc2` (moves the unit's rodata) and a 99.31% `lib_gear` claim whose reloc named another symbol |

## Queue

Units worked through one at a time (one agent per unit, no shared files):

1. `field/main/misc2`, `field/main/misc`, `field/main/misc8` — small field logic,
   plenty of named functions, Default preset.
2. `slus_006.64/system/sound` — 86 stubs, the largest single unit.
3. `slus_006.64/system/model`, `system/rendering`, `system/temp1`.
4. `shop_menu/main/misc`, `lib_gear/main/main`, `gear_shop_menu/main/render`.
5. `slus_006.64/psyq/*` — match by identifying the library version; low hit rate.

Known blocked / low-yield:

- `psyq/libgte` handwritten GTE functions (`mtc2`/`ctc2`) cannot be produced from C
  without inline asm, which is banned; they stay `INCLUDE_ASM`.
- `field/main/misc.c FieldScriptWriteActorFlags1` reaches 95.29% only because
  `g_FieldActors` is declared `volatile`; dropping the qualifier makes the
  function match but breaks the `field` binary elsewhere.

## What the first two rounds taught

- A worker's `MATCH` was not trustworthy until `diff_func.sh` normalised branch
  targets: `j 73a0 <Func+0x50>` and `beq v1,v0,7188 <Func+0x58>` are just
  relocated targets, but the old script printed them as differences, so a
  function could look matched while its C was a different size. Require
  `objdiff: 100.00%`, not the `MATCH` line alone.
- Worker turns are slow (5+ min of thinking per edit) and children time out at
  30 minutes, so a batch of 12 functions is roughly 3x more than one worker can
  finish. Keep batches at 6-8 and have them commit after every few matches.
- `ninja` permanently deletes `build/src/<unit>.c.{i,s,o}` when a build fails,
  and the maspsx edge sends stderr to `/dev/null`, so switching a function
  between C and `INCLUDE_ASM` without re-running gears (`make build`) silently
  yields "success" with no object. Always rebuild through `make`.
- `make check` is the only gate that matters; it caught every false match.

## Round 3 notes

- `system/rendering` does not use `ori $r,$zero,imm` at all (33 `addiu` instead),
  so maspsx must not expand `li` there; `gears.toml` now has a `XenoRendering`
  preset for it. `system/sound` is the opposite (64 `ori`), so this is per-unit.
- The four `FieldScriptWriteActorFlagsN` handlers in `field/main/misc.c` all miss
  by one instruction (`li a0,1` hoisted instead of sitting in the jal delay slot),
  and the cause is the `volatile` on `g_FieldActors` in `include/field/actor.h`
  (105 uses). Someone should test removing it with a full `make check`.
- Clone trees need `expected/` and `objdiff.json`: run `make objdiff-config` in
  the main tree *before* `cp -ac`, or the workers burn their budget rebuilding
  report mode by hand.

## Round 5-8 notes (the playbook that works)

A worker that only knows "write C and diff it" burns its 30 minutes rediscovering
the same six things. Putting these in every brief raised the yield from ~15% to
~70% of claims surviving `make check`:

- A hoisted `li a0,N` where the original keeps it in the `jal` delay slot: pass an
  `int` local, not a literal. (Still unsolved for the `FieldScriptWriteActorFlagsN`
  family, where the argument follows a computed `g_FieldActors[...]` address.)
- `%gp_rel(sym)($gp)` vs `%hi/%lo`: maspsx only emits gp-relative when the unit
  itself defines the symbol (tentative `.sbss` definition), not for `extern`.
- An unused stack slot in the original: declare an unused local (`RECT rect;`).
- A global reached as `offset(base)` where the base is held across a call: keep a
  pointer local, or write the store through a one-member struct so gcc cannot
  hoist it.
- `switch` compiles to a jump table, an `if` chain does not.
- Fields read with `lh`/`lhu` at the high half of a `long` (e.g. `lh 0x22`) are
  `CONV_TO_GTE(position.vx)`, not a struct layout bug.

## Still blocked, with evidence

- `slus_006.64/system/model`: every stub is hand-written assembly except four
  large functions. The `func_800315A0`-`func_80031870` family materialises
  constants through `li $at`, which gcc never does.
- `psyq/libgte`: handwritten `mtc2`/`ctc2` GTE wrappers, unreachable from C.
- `field/main/misc.c`: `FieldScriptWriteActorFlags1..4` (95.29%, one delay slot),
  `func_80087FA4` (79.83%, `&D_800B2348` in a register vs `lui $at`).
- `field/main/misc11.c`, `shop_menu/main/misc.c`: switch functions that compile
  to section-relative `.rodata` tables where the original names a `jtbl_` symbol.
  objdiff caps at ~99.7% and the linked bytes are the only proof.
- `system/rendering.c func_8001FB30`, `graphics.c GfxLoadImageAccelerated`: both
  move `$sp` into a heap block; only inline asm reproduces that shape.

## Method notes for whoever runs the next session

- Workers run in `cp -ac` clones of this repo under `~/xw/`, on a branch each, and
  commit as they go; the orchestrator fetches each clone as a git remote and
  merges. No shared `build/`, so rounds can overlap.
- Run `make objdiff-config` in the main tree *before* cloning: clones otherwise
  have no `expected/` and every worker spends budget rebuilding report mode.
- Require both `MATCH:` and `objdiff: 100.00%`. Require the worker to commit
  every 2-3 matches; children are killed at 30 minutes and lose nothing committed.
- `make check` is the gate and it catches roughly one bad claim per round. To find
  the culprit: `cmp build/out/<bin>.bin disc/<bin>.bin`, map the differing offsets
  to text symbols, then revert just those functions.
